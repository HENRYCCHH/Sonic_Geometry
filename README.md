Sonic Geometry

 A novel approach to visualizing musical intervals has emerged, 
 prioritizing the exploration of consonance and dissonance through 
 graphical representation. Departing from traditional methods reliant 
 on digital audio signals, this project leverages real-time 
 visualization of MIDI signals for its computational feasibility in 
 accurately capturing interval relationships. At its core, the project 
 aims to animate the numerical music intervals, offering users a dynamic 
 and immersive experience.

 Utilizing a sand-painting technique imbues the visuals with 
 a handmade quality, elevating user interaction. Interactive sliders 
 facilitate adjustment of animation speed, line fadeout, and dissonance impact, 
 while gesture controls enhance drawing projection and dynamic color changes 
 within the environment. This immersive experience allows for in-depth exploration 
 of musical interval consonance and dissonance, seamlessly fusing technology 
 with artistic expression.
