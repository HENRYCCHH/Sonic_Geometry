## Overview
Sonic Geometry offers a novel approach to visualizing musical intervals by emphasizing the exploration of consonance and dissonance through dynamic graphical representation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on digital audio signals, this project utilizes real-time MIDI signal visualization to accurately capture and animate numerical music intervals, providing users with a dynamic and immersive experience.

## Features
- **Handmade Visuals:** A unique sand-painting technique adds a handcrafted aesthetic.
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust animation speed, line fadeout, and dissonance impact with intuitive sliders.
- **Gesture-Based Interaction:** Enhance drawing projections and dynamically change colors with gesture controls.
- **Immersive Exploration:** Delve into the interplay of musical consonance and dissonance, seamlessly blending technology with artistic expression.
